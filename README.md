## About
This repository is part of my personal journey to improve my skills in Java. It contains various exercises, mini-projects, and code snippets that I’ve worked on as I learn key Java concepts.

## Getting Started
To get started with the code in this repository:

1. Make sure you have [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) installed.
2. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-learning-journey.git
    ```
3. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd java-learning-journey
    ```
4. Compile and run the Java files:
    ```bash
    javac Filename.java
    java Filename
    ```

## Projects
Here are some of the projects and exercises included in this repository:

- **Hello World**: A simple introductory program.
- **Basic Calculator**: A calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.
- **OOP Examples**: Programs that demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming principles.
- **File Handling**: Examples showing how to read and write files in Java.
- **Collections**: Exercises that explore the use of ArrayList, HashMap, and other Java collections.
- **Java Swing**: Simple GUI applications using Java Swing.

## Concepts Covered
Throughout this repository, I cover a range of important Java topics, including:

- **Variables and Data Types**
- **Control Flow Statements (if, switch, loops)**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
  - Classes and Objects
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Encapsulation
- **Error Handling (try-catch)**
- **Java Collections Framework**
- **Streams and Lambda Expressions**
- **Multithreading**
- **File I/O (Input/Output)**
- **Basic GUI with Java Swing**
